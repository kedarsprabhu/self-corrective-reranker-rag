At their basic level, computers are incredibly dumb. They need to be given \\nvery precise instructions with no room for ambiguity. The only language understood by a \\ncomputer’s hardware directly is its machine language.  Each instruction in the machine \\nlanguage is just a sequence of 0’s and 1’s encoded as strings of bits (Figure 8) in the \\ncomputer’s memory.  The data that these instructions act upon are themselves just strings \\nof bits that encode numbers, letters, and other values. The instructions describe simple \\nactions such as to add two integers or move data from one memory location to another.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 8. Computer and Its Bits \\n[Microsoft Word Clip Art] \\n \\nA process that a human programmer wishes to encode within a computer is typically \\nstated in much different terms than sequences of bits.  How can we bridge the gap',\n",
       " 'stated in much different terms than sequences of bits.  How can we bridge the gap \\nbetween the high-level concepts in the process as understood by humans and the low-\\nlevel actions that can be carried out by a computer? \\n \\nLet’s look back at the recipe in Figure 7.  It gives the direction to “stir in the morsels and \\nnuts.” Think about this for a moment.  This is really a high-level description of a whole \\nbunch of small actions such as: pick up 10 morsels and 3 nuts, put these in the mixing \\nbowl, pick up a spatula, insert the spatula into the batter in the bowl, move spatula in a \\ncircular motion for 7 revolutions, remove the spatula (do not lick it!), put down the \\nspatula, and then repeat this sequence again until all morsels and nuts are evenly \\ndistributed in the batter.  Then, if we think about each of these smaller actions, we see \\nthat they are also high-level descriptions of even lower-level sequences of actions.  And \\nso forth.',\n",
       " 'so forth. \\n \\nSimilarly, if we wish to design a computer program for a process, we start with a high-\\nlevel, but precise, description of the process and its data (i.e., the requirements) and \\ndecompose each action or type of data into simpler actions and data.  We then focus on \\neach simpler item and decompose it further.  We continue this technique until we can \\nexpress the actions and data in terms that are meaningful to the computer hardware.  We \\noften organize the resulting software design into a layered architecture as show in Figure \\n9. One layer provides small processes that can be used to implement the larger processes',\n",

We can think of a layer as a virtual machine of software instructions \\navailable to implement programs in the higher layer.  \\n \\nOf course, programmers don’t have to go all the way to the machine language layer every \\ntime. They can reuse a lower layer that has been designed and implemented previously. \\nThey can also use specialized software tools (i.e., programs) to help develop the desired \\nnew program. For example, consider Figure 9 again. Suppose Layer 1 represents a high-\\nlevel programming language. A programmer might then use that programming language \\nto write a new program in Layer 2.  Then the programmer can use a software tool called a \\ncompiler to translate this high-level language program to a machine language program \\nthat is supported by the machine (Layer 0).  This is illustrated by Figure 10.',\n",

Although computer scientists \\nmay play computer games, surf the web, use word processors and spreadsheets, and even \\nopen up the case on a PC and tinker with the hardware from time to time, those are not \\nactivities that describe what it means to be a computer scientist.

Computer science researchers \\nwork to extend and deepen our understanding of these fundamentals.

They should also be able to \\ndetermine how efficient an algorithm is, that is, how much time and storage space does \\nthe algorithm take to run in proportion to the size of its inputs.

They must be able to develop an algorithm for a \\nproblem and describe it in a representation appropriate to execute on a computer.
